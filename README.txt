With this SolPlanet app you can let your Homey Pro read the data from your SolPlanet inverter.

To use this app it is required for you to know the local IP Address of the inverter and the device serial number. You can find the serial number on the sticker on the inverter.

The app will read the data from the inverter every 30 seconds and store it in the Homey Pro. You can use the data to create flows and insights. The current power production, the daily production and the total production are available.
